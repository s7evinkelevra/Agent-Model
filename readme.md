Fitness calculation is relative (to maintain a constant population size), such that the number of offspring is always equal the number of dying hosts. More details in the fitness calculation section [hosts are sorted by fitness and the top proportion of fittest hosts is resistent the bottom proportion susceptible].
  - Relative fitness: proportion of surviving/dying hosts each generation
    - Number of offspring -> depends on fitness calculation; if 50% of hosts die each generation, the remaining 50 need to produce on offspring each (2 gametes per host)
  - Mutation rate
  - Each Host can be infected once by one (-> or maybe multiple?) parasite each generation
    - Whether is host is resistent or susceptible is determined by the relative fitness (fittest x% of all hosts are resistent, rest is susceptible)
  - If fitness is greater than one:
    1. The host will produces two gametes with one allele each
    2. Determine if mutation occurs and apply it
    3. Gametes of all reproducing hosts fuse according to the reproduction regieme
